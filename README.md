# Fan Percent Button Row
Provides a means to program 3 preset speed percentage settings for fans selectable from a Lovelace button row.

## NOTE: You must be on Home Assistant V2021.3.X or higher to use this plug-in

Installation:

The easiest way to install this is to use the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) in Home Assistant.

Follow the instructions there for installation making sure you note the "url:" section for the resources addition.


Conversely, if you don't use HACS you can install it manually by performing the following:

Copy the fan-percent-button-row.js file to the appropriate folder in your Home Assistant Configuration directory (/config/www/).

Place the following in your "resources" section in your lovelace configuration (updating the location to where you placed the above file):

  ```
    - url: /local/fan-percent-button-row.js
      type: module
  ```
    
Then to use this in a card place the following in your entity card:
